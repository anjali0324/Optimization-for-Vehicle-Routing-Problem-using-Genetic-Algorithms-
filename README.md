# Optimization-for-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithms-

 #• Utilized DEAP to implement genetic algorithms &tuned 3 parameters namely: mutation rates, crossover probabilities, and selection
 #• Achieved a best fitness score of 578.47 after 500 generations of the genetic algorithm, enhancing route efficiency and performance
 #• Achieved a 15% boost in the route efficiency for the VRP and effectively utilized Matplotlib to visualize the optimized routing solutions
